//! `vyre-driver-cuda` through `cuLaunchCooperativeKernel` and that:
//!   - On hardware that supports cooperative launch, output is byte-identical
//!     to the same Program dispatched via the regular `cuLaunchKernel` path.
//!   - On hardware that does NOT support cooperative launch (or when the
//!     device's `cooperative_launch` capability is false), the backend
//!     returns `BackendError::UnsupportedFeature` instead of silently falling
//!     back. Hardware-fail mode is the explicit, structured signal the runtime
//!     needs to make the kernel-split-fallback decision in
//!     `vyre_driver::grid_sync::dispatch_with_grid_sync_split`.
//!
//! These tests require a CUDA device. Backend acquisition failure is a test
//! failure on the GPU-required Vyre test hosts.
