//! Single-input segmentation for the megakernel scan.
//!
//! Today a work-item is `(file_idx, rule_idx)` and each lane scans the WHOLE
//! file for one rule (`dispatcher.rs`: `file_idx = claim / rule_count`). For one
//! large file that leaves occupancy bounded by `rule_count`, with every busy lane
//! walking all N bytes sequentially — the reason the GPU loses to Hyperscan on a
//! single 8 MiB scan. Splitting each file into many overlapping windows turns the
//! work-item into `(segment_idx, rule_idx)`, so a single file saturates the whole
//! device (see `docs/GPU_OOM_SEGMENTATION.md`).
//!
//! ## Soundness (why overlapping windows are exact)
//!
//! For an Aho-Corasick / failure-function DFA, the state after consuming the byte
//! at offset `i` is a function of at most the last `overlap` bytes (the longest
//! pattern), independent of the state the scan started in. So a window that
//! begins scanning `overlap` bytes BEFORE the region it owns reaches the exact
//! state a full-file scan would have at `emit_start`. Each window therefore:
//!   * scans `[scan_start, emit_end)` from state 0 — the `[scan_start, emit_start)`
//!     prefix is warm-up only, it emits nothing; and
//!   * emits only matches whose END offset lies in `[emit_start, emit_end)`.
//!
//! The emit ranges tile `[0, file_len)` exactly — contiguous, gap-free, and
//! disjoint — so every match is produced by exactly one window: no double count,
//! no miss. `plan_segments` is the host-side planner; the kernel reads the
//! resulting table to derive `(file_idx, scan_start, emit_start, emit_end)` from
//! a claim, and guards emission with `end >= emit_start && end < emit_end`.

/// One scan window of a file.
